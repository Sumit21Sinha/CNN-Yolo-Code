**Manual Convolutional Neural Networks Coding (2 Layers)**

This project involves **manually coding and implementing two layers of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** as part of a simplified YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture, specifically tailored for a **vehicle tracking system**. 
The goal is to build a foundational understanding of how the mathematics of CNNs work under the hood, knowledge that is essential for both *deep learning applications* and *hardware-level chip design* in the future.

## Key Features

- üß† Manual implementation of 2-layer CNN from scratch (no deep learning libraries)

- üñºÔ∏è PIL-based image import and visualization

- üßÆ Mathematical insights into CNN operation and convolution

- üß∞ Code modularity to support future model expansion

Tech Stack Used - Python, Numpy, PIL, Matplotlib, Knowledge of Machine Learning, Mathematics.
